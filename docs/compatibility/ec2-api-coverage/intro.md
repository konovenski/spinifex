### Spot Instances Are a Mock

Spot Instance Requests are a mock over the on-demand `RunInstances` path. A request synchronously launches real VMs on the operator's own compute and is then reported `active` and `fulfilled`. There is no spot market: no bidding, no price rejection, no interruption and no reclamation, and instances are never taken back.
